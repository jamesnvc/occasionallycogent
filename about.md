Hi! My name is James Norman Vladimir Cash.

I usually go by jamesnvc on the internet.

I'm the co-founder of a software company called [Bloom][bloom] that is working on a number of things -- some that are public at the moment are [Braid chat][braid] and [Rookie][getrookie].

I live in Toronto, Canada and have lived here my whole life (except a brief internship in California).

In addition to programming, I enjoy strength training & competing in various strength sports - powerlifting, strongman, and highland games.
I used to run marathons & do triathlons, but I am approximately 40kg heavier than I was then, so not so much with the running now.
Still love cycling and swimming though!
