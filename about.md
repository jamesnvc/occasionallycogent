I'm the co-founder of a software company Bloom Ventures (formerly Lean Pixel).

I live in Toronto, Canada and have lived here my whole life (except a brief internship in California).

In addition to programming, I enjoy strength training & competing in various strength sports - powerlifting, strongman, and highland games.
