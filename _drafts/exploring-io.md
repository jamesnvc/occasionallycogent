title: "Exploring Io"
---

I first heard about the [Io programming language][iolang] quite a while ago -- I believe I saw it in [Steve Yegge's][steveyegge][^yegge] sidebar when I was still in high school and just starting to get interested in different programming languages.
Recently, it came up again on [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs) and I decided to have another look at it.

  [^yegge]: I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Steve Yegge: his [original blog](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/) was a huge influence on me when I first started programming and has really shaped the sort of developer I am today.
