A big part of my life since about 2010 has been strength training.
I was always drawn to self-improvement and physical training was something I'd always been interested in.
I did martial arts for a number of years, enjoyed running and playing rugby, but the big thing for me was being introduced to lifting weights by a friend & coach on my engineering dragon boat team.

I fell in love with lifting weights for a number of reasons.
I was at the time in my third year of a very challenging engineering program at the University of Toronto and wrestling with depression.
The weights didn't help with depression (only therapy did), but they did help a lot with the stress of school.
Even when my mental health wasn't great, weights provided a great outlet for my emotions.

As I finished school and reached a better place mentally, I continued to lift weights, but also started to compete.
I've competed in three of the big strength sports now and at least know people that do two of the other big ones, so I thought I'd write up a sort of description of what the big sports are (and maybe why you would care).

# Sports I don't do

The two most popular and well-known of the strength sports are also the sports I don't do (I'm a contrarian), Olympic weightlifting and bodybuilding.

## Bodybuilding

Bodybuilding is probably the first thing most people think of when they hear "strength sports" -- Giant ripped guys in little underwear on stage.

Competitions are basically beauty pageants -- the competitors hit their required poses, judges compare them, and decide who looks best.
There are more details as to exactly how they compare and what they're looking for, but it essentially comes down to who looks "the best".

Bodybuilding is basically the sport of discipline.
While the other sports also require lots of time in the gym training, bodybuilding takes that as a given and additionally demands an obsessive, 24-hour-a-day lifestyle adherence.
To reach the contest-ready levels of bodyfat[^fat]  while maintaining as much of their hard-earned muscle as possible necessitates a demented level of attention to detail over every aspect of one's life -- not just meticulous meal prep, but supplementation, sleep, hydration, and even sodium levels must be micromanaged.

There is somewhat of a dichotomy of bodybuilding between "natural" -- meaning drug-tested -- federations and, uh, "otherwise".
If you've ever seen a bodybuilder in a magazine or whatever, they are probably in the later camp.
Professional bodybuilding has kind of become an exercise in seeing how far various pharmaceuticals can take the human body -- at this point, steroids are virtually a given (in, if rumors are true, gargantuan doses at the higher levels) and the current frontier is in peptides (e.g. human growth hormone, insulin), diuretics (to get as shredded as possible), and who knows what else.

For professional bodybuilders, the highest honor is the Olympia, a year competition created by Joe Weider.
There a number of other competitions such as the Arnold (at the eponymous festival in Ohio, which also features (among many other things) strongman and powerlifting competitions) but the Olypmia is the pinnacle.

There is a great deal of politics in the sport, since judging winners is an inherently subject thing, but I am very unqualified to talk about that.

Most athletes in the other strength sports take some cues from body builders when it comes to dieting to stay in their weight class or when trying to put on additional muscle mass in their off-season.

## Olympic Weightlifting

Olympic weightlifting is, as the name suggests, the weightlifting people do at the Olympics.
It has the distinction of being the most legitimate of the strength sports, because its Olympic sport status means it has one governing body, one consistent set of rules, and one ultimate goal for all competitive athletes -- to lift at the Olympics.

Olympic lifting consists of two lifts, the snatch and the clean & jerk.
There used to be a third lift, the clean & press, but it was removed in 1972[^cleanpress].
Both lifts are very technical and performed at very high speeds.

The snatch is simply bringing the bar from the ground to overhead in one smooth movement.

The clean & jerk is two movements -- in the first part, the bar is brought from the ground to the shoulders in one motion (the clean), then the lifter dips under the bar and "jerks" it overhead.

# Sports I do do

## Powerlifting

## Strongman

## Highland Games

  [^fat]: which is somewhat hard to nail down with an exact percentage, but generally thought to be in the 3-5% range for pros
  [^cleanpress]: It was removed due to difficulty in judging, since the rules required the press be "strict", which could be very hard to objectively determine.
