A big part of my life since about 2010 has been strength training.
I was always drawn to self-improvement and physical training was something I'd always been interested in.
I did martial arts for a number of years, enjoyed running and playing rugby, but the big thing for me was being introduced to lifting weights by a friend & coach on my engineering dragon boat team.

I fell in love with lifting weights for a number of reasons.
I was at the time in my third year of a very challenging engineering program at the University of Toronto and wrestling with depression.
The weights didn't help with depression (only therapy did), but they did help a lot with the stress of school.
Even when my mental health wasn't great, weights provided a great outlet for my emotions.

As I finished school and reached a better place mentally, I continued to lift weights, but also started to compete.
I've competed in three of the big strength sports now and at least know people that do two of the other big ones, so I thought I'd write up a sort of description of what the big sports are (and maybe why you would care).

# Sports I don't do

The two most popular and well-known of the strength sports are also the sports I don't do (I'm a contrarian), Olympic weightlifting and bodybuilding.

## Bodybuilding

Bodybuilding is probably the first thing most people think of when they hear "strength sports" -- Giant ripped guys in little underwear on stage.

Body building is basically the sport of discipline.
While the other sports also require lots of time in the gym training, body building demands an obsessive, 24-hour-a-day lifestyle adherence.
To reach the contest-ready levels of bodyfat[^fat]  while maintaining as much of their hard-earned muscle as possible necessitates a demented level of attention to detail over every aspect of one's life -- not just meticulous meal prep, but supplementation, sleep, hydration, and even sodium levels must be micromanaged.

Most athletes in the other strength sports take some cues from body builders when it comes to dieting to stay in their weight class or when trying to put on additional muscle mass in their off-season.
