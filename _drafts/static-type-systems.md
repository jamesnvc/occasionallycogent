title: "Static Type Systems"
---

Most of the work I've been doing the last few years has been in Clojure.
I really enjoy the language, but I always like trying to experiment with new things and challenge myself.
To that end, the last few side projects ([Braid][braid] bots) have been written in different languages -- [two][giphybot] [bots][octocat] in Rust, [one][greeterbot] in Haskell, and one (currently in progress) in Elixir.

 I wanted to try using Rust and Haskell because I've been using more dynamically typed languages the past few years and I wanted to gain a better appreciation of strong type systems.
 Haskell in particular is a language that I've been interested in on-and-off since high school and really wanted to appreciate.
