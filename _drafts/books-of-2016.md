title: "Books I read in 2016"
---

I started making a concerted effort to always have at least one book in progress this year.
I love reading, but I realized that at this point, I need to work at it to make sure I have books to read.
Luckily, the Toronto Public Library is amazing, there is a branch near me, and it is really easy to put holds on books online.

In no particular order, books I read enjoyed this year.

# The Power Broker, by Robert Caro

# Lenin's Tomb, by David Remnick

# The Ground Beneath Her Feet, by Salman Rushdie

# Seveneves, by Neal Stephenson
