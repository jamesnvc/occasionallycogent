title: "Books I read in 2016"
---

I started making a concerted effort to always have at least one book in progress this year.
I love reading, but I realized that at this point, I need to work at it to make sure I have books to read.
Luckily, the Toronto Public Library is amazing, there is a branch near me, and it is really easy to put holds on books online.

In no particular order, books I read enjoyed this year.

# The Power Broker, by Robert Caro

The history of the man that essentially single-handedly shaped New York.

I'd seen this book recommended as a bunch of peoples' all-time favourite books, so I thought it warranted a read.
Really enjoyed it -- Caro does a great job of making what could be incredibly tedious minutiae really gripping.

# Lenin's Tomb, by David Remnick

# The Ground Beneath Her Feet, by Salman Rushdie

# Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights, by Salman Rushdie

# Seveneves, by Neal Stephenson
