title: "Books I read in 2016"
---

I started making a concerted effort to always have at least one book in progress this year.
I love reading, but I realized that at this point, I need to work at it to make sure I have books to read.
Luckily, the Toronto Public Library is amazing, there is a branch near me, and it is really easy to put holds on books online.

In no particular order, books I read enjoyed this year.

# The Battle Cry of Freedom, by James McPherson

Amazingly comprehensive history of the American civil war.

This was the book that kicked off my period of reading history books this year.
I saw Ta-Nehisi Coates recommend it on Twitter as one of the best one-volume histories ever written, so I decided to give it a read.

It was excellent -- like the next book in the list, the author does an excellent job of making all the small details of economics and politics riveting.
Having never learned about the American civil war in school, this book gave me an excellent overview of the event, one that I hope will help me better understand the bewildering American psyche.

# The Power Broker, by Robert Caro

The history of the man that essentially single-handedly shaped New York.

I'd seen this book recommended as a bunch of peoples' all-time favourite books, so I thought it warranted a read.
Really enjoyed it -- Caro does a great job of making what could be incredibly tedious minutiae really gripping.

One thing I found very interesting reading the book is how important women were to the story of Robert Moses:
He was in many ways shaped by his mother & grandmother and his downfall was precipitated by a group of women.

# Lenin's Tomb, by David Remnick

At some point, I became interested in knowing more about the history of the Soviet Union.
I was hoping that I'd be able to find the equivalent of *The Battle Cry of Freedom* for the Soviet Union, but apparently it is something too large to be contained in a single volume.

Remnick's book is the story of the fall of Soviet Union, but in the process, it describes a lot about its history and how that lead to its downfall.


# The Ground Beneath Her Feet, by Salman Rushdie

Salman Rushdie has become one of my favourite fiction authors and has kind of overtaken Michael Ondaatje in my affection (although I'll always love *In the Skin of a Lion*).

# Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights, by Salman Rushdie

I read this right after *The Ground Beneath Her Feet*, which I think worked well (it made me realize the significance of the time span that repeatedly came up in that previous story).
It was much shorter than that previous story and much more straight-up fantasy than I expected.
Very fun story, really cool to read a fantasy novel written by one of the greatest novelists of all time.

# Seveneves, by Neal Stephenson

I really like Neal Stephenson's science fiction (*Anathem* is one of my favourite books) and his newest was no exception.
The first three-quarters of the book was absolutely brutal and nail-biting; the latter quarter was a really neat science fiction story.

# Between the World and Me, by Ta-Nehisi Coates

Ta-Nehisi Coates is a fantastic author and *Between the World and Me* is a really painful description of what it is to be a black man in the United States.
