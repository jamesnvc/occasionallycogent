For most of my life, I've identified as some that can't draw.
I'm not sure why -- my mother and step-mother are both artists -- but maybe I was discouraged by seeing expert-level proficiency early on and recognizing that I couldn't do that.

Anyway, I always proclaimed that I lacked all artistic ability for years, even though I secretly wanted to learn.
I'd occasionally try reading things like "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain", but I would be too embarrassed to let anyone see me reading it or, even worse, practicing.
