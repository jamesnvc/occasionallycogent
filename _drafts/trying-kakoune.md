title: "Trying Kakoune"

The multi-selection is really neat and powerful, but I don't do multi-line editing particularly often -- and when I do, vim's `global` is usually enough for me (e.g. I visual select a region, then I can do `:'<,'>g/^/norm <stuff>`.)

I really like being able to create splits in vim willy-nilly, to quickly look at another file, to get a temporary buffer, or whatever.
While I appreciate that it's kind of redundant when also using tmux, kakoune's approach makes it just heavyweight enough to discourage me from quickly opening splits, although I suppose that could be fixed with some tmux aliases...
