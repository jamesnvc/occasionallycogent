title: "Algorithms Are Not Neutral"
---

It seems like more and more companies and people these days are becoming enamoured with various machine learning techniques in lieu of human judgement.
I worry that people have forgotten or never realized that algorithms will only codify the biases you feed them with -- they are not objective arbiters of judgement, but unthinking enforcers of what they have been told.
